# Weather Forecast Web App

## Task
You are required to produce a Weather Forecast app and reflect on best practices with regards to the architecture of the application. As such you will produce 3 prototypes, reflect on the progress made, and submit a final version at the end.

#### Following weather data must be included in all the prototypes;

City name (eg: Kathmandu, Nepal)  
Day and Date (eg: Jan 20, 2023)  
Weather condition (eg: Broken clouds, scattered rain)  
Weather icon (as per the weather conditions)
Temperature  
Pressure  
Wind speed  
Humidity  
The Units of measurement should be metric units.

### Prototype1

In this first version of your app, you should get a simple HTML/JavaScript
page to retrieve live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and
present the information suitably on a webpage.
When the weather app loads for the first time, it should display the weather
info of your assigned city. You have to add a search bar to search for any
desired city afterwards.

### Prototype2

In this second version of your prototype, you will implement server-side
caching of the weather data, in order to avoid accessing the
OpenWeatherMap API too often. This will be achieved with PHP and MySQL,
as covered in the workshops.
Furthermore your app should be able to display the weather information of the
past week, all the weather data of the past week should be loaded from
your database.

### Prototype3

In this third and final version of your prototype, you will implement browser
caching of the weather data, in order to avoid network / server access when
not required. This can be achieved with the localStorage JavaScript API. You should host your weather app on a free web hosting platform and you should also enable client side chasing to make the webpage accessible in offline mode.
